# multimodal_recommendation_system

• Conducted EDA on the data, trained on both Text and Image data, and successfully deployed using Streamlit
• Compared NLP techniques: BoW, TF-IDF, IDF for vectorization of text data to execute Collaborative Filtering
• Utilized CNN based ResNet- 50 model to vectorize the image data in order to execute Content based Filtering
• Used Cosine similarity, KNN to predict most similar recommendations, TF- IDF gave best results for text data
